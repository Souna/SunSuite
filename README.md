# Suite of game development tools

This GitHub project offers a collection of game development tools. Currently a work-in-progress, the project includes a custom binary file manager and map creator designed specifically for creating simple 2D sidescroller games.

The envisioned game project relies on binary files with a unique ".sun" extension to load all game data, such as maps, images, sounds, and player data. These binary files follow a custom format tailored exclusively for this project.

The following tools are being developed as part of this project:

☀ SunFileManager: This tool allows you to create and modify the binary files that store all game data. It presents the contents of the files in a user-friendly hierarchical treeview structure, making it easy to understand and navigate. This project is based on HaRepacker, which is a custom tool by Haha01Haha01, created for MapleStory file editing.

☀ SunEditor: With this drag-and-drop map creator, you can freely place game assets in any arrangement. It enables you to save asset positions and properties to the SunFiles, which in turn creates a playable game map. This project is also heavily based on HaCreator, which is a custom map editor for MapleStory, created by Haha01Haha01.

☀ Unnamed Game: The ultimate objective of this project is to develop a fully functional 2D sidescrolling game by utilizing the aforementioned tools and harnessing the capabilities of the [olc::PixelGameEngine](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcPixelGameEngine) by OneLoneCoder.
