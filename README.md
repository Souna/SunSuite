# Suite of game development tools

Work-in-progress custom binary file manager and map creator, aimed at creating a simple 2d sidescroller game project.

The planned game project will load all data (maps, images, sounds, player data) from binary files with a custom format created for this project, which have the file extension ".sun."

Tools that will be used to create said game include:

- ☀SunFileManager (Creates and modifies the binary files in which all game data is stored. Displays file contents in an easy-to-understand hierarchical treeview structure.)

- ☀SunMapCreator (A drag-and-drop map creator which enables you to freely place game assets in any manner, and save their positions + properties to the SunFiles in order to create a playable game map.)

- ☀Unnamed Game (The ultimate goal of this project is to have a completely working 2d sidescrolling game using the above described tools and leveraging the power of the olc::PixelGameEngine.)
